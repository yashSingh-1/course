The 56-bit key is divided into two 28-bit halves.

Each round key is generated using left circular shifts and compression permutations to produce 48-bit keys for each round.

Strengths of DES:

Simplicity and Speed: Fast in hardware implementation.

Widespread Use: Used as a standard for decades; well studied and understood.

Feistel Structure: Allows for easy encryption and decryption with the same algorithm.

Weaknesses of DES:

Short Key Length (56-bit): Vulnerable to brute-force attacks. Modern computers can crack DES in hours or even minutes.

Not Secure Against Differential and Linear Cryptanalysis: These are advanced techniques that can break DES faster than brute force.

Obsolete: Replaced by AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) due to security limitations.

Conclusion: While DES was a milestone in cryptographic design, its small key size and vulnerability to cryptanalysis have rendered it obsolete in modern security systems.

2. Compare MAC and Hash functions. How does authentication using hash functions work?
MAC (Message Authentication Code):

A MAC is a short piece of information used to authenticate a message and to provide integrity and authenticity.

It uses a secret key and a message to produce a tag.

Common MAC algorithms: HMAC, CMAC.

Hash Function:

A hash function takes an input (message) and produces a fixed-size hash value.

It does not require a key.

Common hash functions: MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256.

Comparison Table:


Feature	MAC	Hash Function
Key Requirement	Requires a secret key	Does not use a key
Purpose	Message authentication & integrity	Data integrity (not authentication)
Output	Fixed-size tag (depends on MAC used)	Fixed-size digest (e.g., 128/256 bits)
Example Algorithms	HMAC-SHA256, HMAC-MD5	SHA-1, SHA-256, MD5
Authentication Support	Yes	No (unless combined with key)
Collision Resistance	Depends on underlying hash or cipher	Important property
Authentication Using Hash Functions:

Hash functions alone do not provide authentication, but they can be combined with a secret key to achieve authentication, as in:

HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code):

Combines a secret key with the hash function.

Format: HMAC(K, M) = H((K' ⊕ opad) || H((K' ⊕ ipad) || M))

K': Derived key padded to block size.

ipad and opad: Inner and outer padding constants.

Provides both integrity and authentication.

3. Describe MD5 and SHA algorithms in detail. Compare their structure and security.
MD5 (Message Digest 5):

Developed by Ron Rivest in 1991.

Produces a 128-bit hash from any input.

Structure:

Message is padded to 512-bit blocks.

Processes message in 4 rounds of 16 operations each.

Uses logical functions like AND, OR, XOR, NOT and additions modulo 2³².

Widely used in early digital signatures and file verification.

Security Issues with MD5:

Collision Vulnerable: Two different messages can produce the same hash.

Not collision-resistant, thus unsuitable for authentication or digital signatures.

SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm):

SHA-1:
Developed by NSA; produces a 160-bit hash.

Similar structure to MD5 with more rounds (80 rounds).

Vulnerable to collision attacks (as of 2005 and later proven in 2017).

SHA-2 Family:
Includes SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, etc.

SHA-256 is the most commonly used; produces a 256-bit hash.

Uses 64 rounds, secure bitwise operations, modular additions.

Comparison Table:


Feature	MD5	SHA-1	SHA-256 (SHA-2)
Hash Length	128 bits	160 bits	256 bits
Rounds	64 rounds	80 rounds	64 rounds
Collision Resistance	Weak	Weak	Strong (as of now)
Speed	Fast	Moderate	Slightly Slower
Security	Broken (Not secure)	Broken (Not secure)	Secure (widely used)
Use Cases Today	Legacy, checksums (not secure)	Deprecated	Digital signatures, TLS, etc.
Conclusion:

MD5 and SHA-1 are obsolete due to their vulnerability to collision attacks.

SHA-256 and higher variants of the SHA-2 family are currently secure and widely used.

When strong cryptographic security is required, SHA-256 or SHA-3 is preferred.

Here’s a detailed explanation for each of your 15-mark questions related to digital signatures and security protocols:

1. What is a Digital Signature? How is it implemented using RSA? Explain with an example.
Digital Signature: A digital signature is a cryptographic technique used to provide authentication, integrity, and non-repudiation for digital messages or documents. It ensures that the message was sent by the claimed sender and was not altered.

Steps in RSA-based Digital Signature:

RSA is an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm that uses a public and private key pair.

Key Generation (RSA):

Generate two large primes: 
𝑝
p and 
𝑞
q

Compute 
𝑛
=
𝑝
×
𝑞
n=p×q

Compute 
𝜙
(
𝑛
)
=
(
𝑝
−
1
)
(
𝑞
−
1
)
ϕ(n)=(p−1)(q−1)

Choose public exponent 
𝑒
e (usually 65537)

Compute private key 
𝑑
d such that 
𝑑
×
𝑒
m
o
d
 
 
𝜙
(
𝑛
)
=
1
d×emodϕ(n)=1

Signing (Sender):

Calculate the hash of the message 
𝑀
M: 
𝐻
(
𝑀
)
H(M)

Create signature: 
𝑆
=
𝐻
(
𝑀
)
𝑑
m
o
d
 
 
𝑛
S=H(M) 
d
 modn

Send 
𝑀
M and 
𝑆
S to the receiver

Verification (Receiver):

Compute hash of received message: 
𝐻
(
𝑀
)
H(M)

Decrypt signature: 
𝐻
′
=
𝑆
𝑒
m
o
d
 
 
𝑛
H 
′
 =S 
e
 modn

If 
𝐻
(
𝑀
)
=
𝐻
′
H(M)=H 
′
 , the signature is valid

Example:

Let:

𝑀
M = "Hello"

𝐻
(
𝑀
)
H(M) = 1234 (simplified hash)
