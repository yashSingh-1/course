In 2020,[ ISRO](https://www.isro.gov.in/) (Indian Space Research Organisation) and the Indian Air Force selected four test pilots as astronaut candidates for India’s[ Gaganyaan](https://www.isro.gov.in/Gaganyaan.html) mission, the nation’s first human spaceflight program.

   are set to make history.\
   The Gaganyaan mission, slated for 2025, aims to send two to three astronauts to a 400 km low Earth orbit for seven days, using the [GSLV Mk III](https://www.isro.gov.in/GSLVmk3_CON.html) rocket. This milestone will make India the fourth nation to independently launch humans into space, following the US, Russia, and China. The selected candidates, all elite IAF test pilots, bring exceptional skills to this ambitious endeavor.

## 1.Group Captain Ajit Krishnan

**Group Captain Ajit Krishnan**, born in 1982 in Chennai, is a President’s gold medal awardee with over 2,900 hours of flight experience. Commissioned in 2003, he has flown [Sukhoi Su-30 MKI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukhoi_Su-30MKI), Jaguar, and [MiG-21](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikoyan-Gurevich_MiG-21) aircraft. A test pilot at the Aircraft and Systems Testing Establishment ([ASTE](https://indianairforce.nic.in/iaf-test-facilities/)), Krishnan underwent Russian training and continues mission-specific preparations in India. His expertise ensures reliable handling of spacecraft systems.

## 2. **Group Captain Prashanth Balakrishnan Nair**

**Group Captain Prashanth Balakrishnan Nair**, born in 1976 in Kerala, is the senior-most candidate. A Sword of Honour recipient, Nair was commissioned in 1998 and has over 3,000 hours of flying experience on Sukhoi [Su-30 MKI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukhoi_Su-30MKI), [MiG-21](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikoyan-Gurevich_MiG-21), and [Hawk jets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAE_Systems_Hawk). A test pilot and instructor, he trained in Russia (2020-2021) at the [Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuri_Gagarin_Cosmonaut_Training_Center), mastering spaceflight systems and microgravity simulations. Nair’s leadership and experience position him as a likely mission commander.

## 3. **Group Captain Angad Pratap**

**Wing Commander Shubhanshu Shukla**, born in 1985 in Lucknow, is the youngest candidate. Commissioned in 2006, he has over 2,000 hours of flight experience and is a test pilot. Trained in Russia and India, Shukla’s agility and technical acumen make him key to managing spacecraft operations and mission objectives.

The candidates trained for 13 months in Russia, learning spacecraft systems, survival techniques, and microgravity experiments. In India, they use ISRO’s Bengaluru facility for simulator training and mission rehearsals. Their preparation ensures readiness for spaceflight challenges, from navigation to emergency response.

Gaganyaan is a symbol of India’s technological prowess and national pride. These astronauts, with their rigorous training and aviation expertise, embody the mission’s spirit. Their journey from fighter pilots to space explorers inspires millions and paves the way for future Indian space endeavors, including a potential space station. As 2025 approaches, Nair, Krishnan, Pratap, and Shukla stand ready to etch India’s name in space history.
